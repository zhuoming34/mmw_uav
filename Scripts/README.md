# Sample Generator
Generates sample points for model training. Each sample point consists of a 3D radar intensity map and a 2D depth image. 

# radarSph2Cart
Converts the 3d radar intensity map from spherical coordinate system to Cartesian coordinate system

#showPC2I_pp
Generates 2d depth image from camera reflector point cloud by perspective projection
