# Sample Synthesizer
Generates sample points for model training. Each sample point consists of a 3D radar intensity map and a 2D depth image. 

# Step-by-step scripts
- Generate single box point cloud
- Set up a scene with multiple boxes point cloud
- Ptc2DepImg.m: Genreate 2D depth images from point cloud models
- radarSph2Cart.m: Convert 3D intensity maps from spherical coordinate to Cartesian coordinate with a speicified boundary
